There are two examples in this folder.

The first is uniform_case:
This folder contains - 

two_plate_conduction.py, which handles the uniform case: two identical plates with identical meshes and different temperature boundary conditions on their opposite edges. the shared edge temperature is computed using a loop with MELDThermal. It uses left_plate.bdf and right_plate.bdf, which can be created with minor modifications to the generate_bdf scripts

tacs_verification.py, which runs the same case but as one unified mesh for comparison.
uses rect_plate.bdf, again can be created with generate_bdf scripts

The second is mesh_density:
This is essentially the same but with two different mesh densities chosen to demonstrate the nearest-neighbor matching capabilities of MELDThermal
The verification case is the same as the one in the uniform_case folder
