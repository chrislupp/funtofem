This folder contains examples of coupled SU2/TACS conjugate heat transfer as well as validation examples that use SU2 multiphysics to run the same cases.

This requires the latest version of SU2 and some modifications to the SU2 Python Wrapper which are detailed below.

SU2 Installation steps:
need automake 1.15 and autoconf 2.65+ to run latest SU2
you can try
./bootstrap
to install these automatically. if this doesn't work, install manually:
--need to download .tar.gz from gnu ftp (autoconf first)
-- ./config --prefix=/home/user/packages/autoconf
-- add the path to autoconf/bin to your PATH variable in ~/.bashrc
-- source ~/.bashrc
-- repeat and do the same thing for automake

then, to compile su2:
make sure you have pcre and swig to build the python interface
if not just need to download tarballs, put in packages directory, ./configure && make && make install

mkdir /home/USER/packages/SU2
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/home/jtrout3/packages/SU2 --enable-mpi --with-cc=mpicc --with-cxx=mpicxx CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 -O3" --enable-PY_WRAPPER

edit ~/.bashrc and add these lines:
export SU2_RUN="/home/home/packages/SU2/bin"
export SU2_HOME="/home/home/git/SU2"
export PATH=$PATH:$SU2_RUN
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$SU2_RUN

then do:
source ~/.bashrc
then, copy the modified CDriver.hpp and python_wrapper_structure.cpp files from the repo into /git/SU2/SU2_CFD/include/drivers and /git/SU2/SU2_CFD/src/
Note: any update to SU2 will break these changes. the only thing necessary is to add the GetVertexAreaHeatFlux function to the Python interface, so you can also just copy that code from each of the files and add it to the version of each file you have

then, make && make install
theoretically you should now be able to do
python
import pysu2
without an error. If that is the case, the coupled SU2/TACS scripts should work.
